            expansive cave system, all while avoiding enemies and collecting coins.</p>
        <p> This project was developed as part of my programming video games module.
        I used this project as an opportunity to learn and implement Advanced Object Oriented techniques, by choosing
        my software design patterns carefully. The outcome of this project was a fully functioning 2D game, complete
        with a custom leaderboard, animations and menus. Video games programming gave me a new found appreciation of
        programming under limited resources (I will never forget the sound my laptop made when I loaded the game).</p>
