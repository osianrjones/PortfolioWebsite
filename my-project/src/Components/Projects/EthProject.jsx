            contracts.</p>
        <p className="text-xl"> Within this project, I have developed a voting system using Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum
            network,
            capable of tackling the challenges we currently face with in-person ballot voting.
            This solution tackles the most prevalent problems faced by ballot voting, such as cost,
            accessibility,
            trust and participation levels. I have simplified interactions with the smart contract through
            accessible
            means and powered by industry leading frameworks such as ``Web3.js''. The website I built as the
            frontend is used throughout the whole process, from registering to vote, casting their vote and
            viewing the election results.</p>
